I guess you can reuse whatever parts you find usefull as long as you do not make a complete ripoff.
ie I dont want to spawn a series of ctf clones like there is with the *a games or chicken defense.
If you reuse some code parts, iam glad about some short notice. It might also save you time&work ;)
